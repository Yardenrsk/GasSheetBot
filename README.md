# GasBot

* A little project I made in order to solve a daily inconvenience
    for my family and I. 
    
* The purpose of this project is to track our gas fuels without 
    keeping any recipts nor getting into the google sheets app (limited amount -
    corporate's car).

* Also, that was a nice opportunity to learn javascript.


## How do we use it?

* We have added the bot to a designated group of my family on
    telegram.
* Each time someone fuels the car - he easily sends the
    amount of gas that was fuled.
    The bot is adding the value our google sheet and replies on
    the chat with the up to date data (a chart + relevant data in text)
* If we want to get information, we just send "0" in the chat 
    and the bot will send us the up to date info.
