# GasBot

* A little project I made in order to solve an inconvenience
    in my family's day-to-day life.
    
* The purpose of this project is to track our gas fuels without 
    keeping any recipts nor getting into the google sheets app and enter the amount manually (limited amount of liters -
    corporate car).

* Also, that was a nice opportunity to learn javascript and using the Telegram Bot API.


## How do we use it?

* We have added the bot to a designated group of my family on
    telegram.
* Each time someone fuels the car - he easily sends the
    amount of gas that was filled.
    The bot is adding the value our google sheet and replies on
    the chat with the up to date data (a chart + relevant data in text)
* If we want to get information, we just send "0" in the chat 
    and the bot will send us the up to date info.
